# PREDICTIVE_ANALYSIS
This question involves various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering, applied to different datasets available in Sklearn. The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics like confusion matrix, R-squared, mean squared error, and Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
This question describes a series of data analysis tasks using different machine learning algorithms on various datasets available in the Sklearn library (a popular machine learning library in Python). Each task involves building a predictive or clustering model for specific datasets and evaluating the model's performance using different metrics.

Here is a summary of the tasks:

1. **Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression**: Using the breast cancer dataset, a logistic regression model is built to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation and the confusion matrix.

2. **Iris Flower Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: The iris dataset is used to build a KNN classification model to classify different types of iris flowers. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search, and the model's performance is assessed through cross-validation.

3. **Boston Housing Prediction with Random Forest**: The Boston housing dataset is utilized to build a random forest regression model to predict the value of owner-occupied homes in different areas of Boston. The model's performance is evaluated using mean absolute error and R-squared.

4. **Breast Cancer Classification with Naive Bayes**: The breast cancer dataset is used again, this time to build a naive Bayes model to predict tumor malignancy. The model's performance is evaluated through cross-validation and the confusion matrix.

5. **Heart Disease Prediction with Decision Tree**: Using the heart disease dataset, a decision tree model is built to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not based on their medical information. Hyperparameters are tuned using grid search, and the model's performance is assessed using cross-validation.

6. **Clustering Iris Flowers with K-Means**: In this task, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to the iris dataset to group flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. The quality of clustering is evaluated using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) metric.

7. **Clustering Wines with Agglomerative Clustering**: The wine dataset is used to identify natural groupings or clusters within the wines based on their chemical composition. Agglomerative clustering is applied, and the results are interpreted.

8. **Diabetes Progression Prediction with Linear Regression**: The diabetes dataset is used to build a linear regression model to predict the progression of diabetes. The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R-squared.

9. **Wine Classification with Logistic Regression**: The wine dataset is utilized once more, but this time a logistic regression model is built to classify different types of wines based on their attributes.

Each task focuses on a specific machine learning algorithm and dataset, and the models' performances are evaluated using appropriate metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness. The goal is to showcase a variety of machine learning techniques and how they can be applied to different types of datasets for predictive modeling and clustering tasks.
